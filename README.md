# Metrics Analysis and Marketing Recommendations
I analyzed the marketing expenses of Showz, a ticket-selling company for events. As part of the analysis, I calculated the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) and ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment). The results showed that investing in sources with low CAC and high ROMI would optimize advertising spend and maximize returns. Additionally, I recommended launching campaigns that drive quick conversions, since a large portion of users make their first purchase within the same month or the following one
